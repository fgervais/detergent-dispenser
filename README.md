# Detergent Dispenser

HE laundry detergent is quite concentrated and front loading washing machines
use really little water. With those two factors put together, it's really easy
to put too much detergent and so soap will be left even after the rinse cycle.

This project aim to automate the dispensing of a precise amount of detergent.
