# Detergent Dispenser

HE laundry detergent is quite concentrated and front loading washing machines
use really little water. With those two factors put together, it's really easy
to put too much detergent and so soap will be left even after the rinse cycle.

This project aim to automate the dispensing of a precise amount of detergent.

## Assembled Unit

After holding the button for 1 seconds, the pump will dispense 7.5ml of
detergent. This has been empirically determined to be the required amount
for a small load on our dishwasher using our usual soap.
